## About Me

I am Kautilya. I work as a Software Engineer at Omron Research Center of America.
I have been involved in developing motion planning algorithms for Omron Adept 
robotic arms. I have also worked on design and testing Localization and mapping 
algorithms for Omron Adept autonomous mobile robots. I am currently working 
developing a QNX based realtime middleware for distributed robot control.
