\begin{resume}

    \section{\mysidestyle \textsc{Summary}}
    I joined Omron Research as their 4th employee and have worked on a wide
    range of research projects mainly focused on Optimization for Motion
    Planning and Control. Before joining Omron, I spent 2 years at LL4MA Lab
    working on Deep Learning for robotic manipulation tasks.\\[1mm]
    I focus on delivering clean and maintainable code while iterating quickly.
    I am passionate about using technology to find solutions to our growing
    social needs.
