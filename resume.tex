\begin{resume}

    \section{\mysidestyle \textsc{Summary}}
    I joined Omron Research as their 4th employee and have worked on a wide
    range of research projects mainly focused on Motion
    Planning and Bin Picking for Industrial Robots. At Omron I pushed for the
    creation of Software Development Standards and created rules for Code Reveiws 
    and Code Quality standards, helping us deliver clean, tested and working code on time.
    Before joining Omron, I spent 2 years at LL4MA Lab
    working on Deep Learning for robotic manipulation tasks.\\[1mm]
    I pride myself in delivering clean and maintainable code while iterating quickly.
    I am passionate about using technology to find solutions to our growing
    social needs.
